# Digitized

## About

This Angular website is made as a school project for my photography account [@d_igitized](https://www.instagram.com/d_igitized/) on Instagram.
Sadly, since my student credits are expired on Azure, the site doesn't have any content left. Unit the migration of my api from C# to Firebase is done, this website will be rather empty.

## Techniques

- Angular 7 (hosted on Firebase)
- C# .NET Core 2.2 REST API (hosted on Azure)

## Legal

You're free to clone this site and use the code. The images can be found in the code of my [API](https://github.com/MoutPessemier/DigitizedApi). If you use my logo or any of the pictures, please link my account and give me a shoutout!
