# Digitized

## About
This website was made as a school project for my photography account @d_igitized on Instagram. It's the first time that I've ever used Angular and I'm sure there will be some redundant code, bad practices, ... (same goes for the API we had to write)

I think it's an okay project for a first time and I sure as hell will be updating and working on it even more!

## Techniques
- Angular
- My own API

## Legal
You're free to clone this site and use the code. Images will be on my API. If you use my logo or any of them, please link my account and give me a shoutout!
