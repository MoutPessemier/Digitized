# Digitized

## About

This Angular website is made as a school project for my photography account @d_gitized on Instagram.
Sadly, since my student credits are expired, the site doesn't have any content left. Unit the migration of my api from C# to Firebase is done, this website will be rather empty.

## Techniques

- Angular 7
- C# .NET Core 2.2 REST API

## Legal

You're free to clone this site and use the code. Images will be on my API. If you use my logo or any of the pictures, please link my account and give me a shoutout!
