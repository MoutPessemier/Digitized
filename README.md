# Digitized
Project around my photography and videography, made as a school project.

## Info
This is my first ever angular app, built for my (amateur) photography career. This task was given by HoGent: Web Applications IV

## Practical
Teacher login:
- web4@hogent.be
- gelukkiggeennetbeans

(luckily this is a private repo, posting passwords can be really dangerous!)

This frontend webapp is linked with the Digitized API.
